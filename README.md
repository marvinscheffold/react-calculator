## Development

```
npm start

## Todo 

- Prevent division by 0 
- Make app independent from outside icons or fonts by adding them to cache for pwa or prodiving fallback
- Replace eval calculation by concatenating functions 
- Refractor renaming "keys" to "input" or something similar (funtionality has outgrown the name far too much)
